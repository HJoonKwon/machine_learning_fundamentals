# Overview
To understand fast growing technologies in machine learning, we need to understand the fundamentals first. Hence, I reimplemented machine learning fundamental algorithms from scratch using Numpy with simple examples on the Jupyter notebook. Although essential mathematical equations needed to implement the algorithms are included on the notebooks, some of the detailed concepts are simplified or skipped not to focus on math itself too much. The core of the algorithms are written as Python scripts, and they are imported and used for test on the notebooks.   

# Installation
`$ conda create -n my_env python=3.10`
